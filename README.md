# Light them all

Try to set all lights on.

## Game rules.

At the beginning of the game, some lights will be lit. Your goal is to light all of them.
But, as you toggle a light (by clicking on it), it will toggle the four direct adjacents lights (not those on diagonals) : 

.T.
TCT
.T.

Where . is a light that won't have its state changed, C is the clicked light, and T is a light which also will have its state toggled.
